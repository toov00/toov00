## RELEVANT STACKS: 

### Blockchain & Web3

![Ethereum](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ethereum-3C3C3D?style=for-the-badge&logo=ethereum&logoColor=white)

These days, I'm mainly working on web3 security tooling. Security is something I'm constantly thinking about, which naturally leads me to spend a lot of time auditing smart contracts and hunting for vulnerabilities.

### DevOps & Infrastructure
![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/kubernetes-326CE5?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes&logoColor=white)
![Terraform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terraform-7B42BC?style=for-the-badge&logo=terraform&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-232F3E?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)

On the infrastructure side, I am pretty comfortable with Kubernetes and the whole ecosystem around it. I use Terraform for infrastructure as code, and I have set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. For monitoring, I have worked with Prometheus and Grafana, plus the ELK stack when I need more detailed logging. Most of my cloud work has been on AWS, though I have dabbled with GCP and Azure too.

### Languages & Frameworks
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white)

I write a lot of Python and JavaScript/Node.js for backend stuff, and I have done my fair share of Java work too (for more private things!). For systems programming, I have used C and C++ when I need that lower-level control. On the frontend, I mostly work with React and Next.js. I have also built some desktop apps with Electron. For testing, I usually reach for Mocha or Pytest depending on what I'm working with.

## CURRENT DIRECTION:

There's a lot of potential in combining AI/ML with blockchain and infrastructure work, so I have been experimenting with that. And of course, I'm always trying to get better at security auditing and contribute to best practices around smart contract security.
